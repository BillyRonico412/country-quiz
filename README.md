- It is a quiz about countries and their capitals.
- You can choose between 2 modes: "Country to Capital" and "Which country does this flag belong to".
- The application will then display the questions and the answers.
- You can then choose the correct answer and the application will tell you if you are right or wrong.
- If you are wrong, you can see the correct answer and try again.
- If you are right, you can move on to the next question.
- At the end of the quiz, you can see your score and try again.

Xstate is very powerful and I really enjoyed using it for this project.
